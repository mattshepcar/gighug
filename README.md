GigHug helps you find friends at gigs using bluetooth LoRa radios and blinky lights.  No internet connection needed!

Pair your wearable blinky lights & radio with the app on your phone and you'll be alerted to any other nearby gighug users.  You can make their lights blink and chat with them through the app.
